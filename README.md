# StyleEase Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on minimizing the risk of customer churn for StyleEase, a company operating in Q4 of 2023. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify potential customers who are likely to churn. Churn refers to the situation where customers leave the platform or stop using the products and services provided by StyleEase.

## Problem Statement

In the fourth quarter of 2023, StyleEase faces the challenge of customer churn. Churn can impact a company's revenue, reputation, and long-term sustainability. Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for retaining customers and maintaining a healthy customer base. StyleEase aims to address this problem by utilizing available data and predictive modeling techniques.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to reduce the likelihood of customer churn for StyleEase. As a data scientist in this role, your responsibility is to develop an effective predictive model using the available data. This model should be capable of identifying potential customers who are at risk of churning. By identifying these customers early, StyleEase can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering tailored incentives, improving customer support, or enhancing the overall customer experience.

## Technologies and Methods

To achieve the project's objective, the following steps and techniques involved:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather relevant data about customer interactions, usage patterns, and engagement with StyleEase's products and services. Preprocess and clean the data to ensure its quality and readiness for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features that capture customer behavior, engagement, and any relevant demographic information. These features will be used as inputs for the predictive model.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into customer behavior, identify trends, and understand potential factors contributing to churn.

4. **Model Selection and Training:** Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction. Train the selected model using historical data, making use of techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Choose suitable evaluation metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to measure the performance of the predictive model.

6. **Interpretation:** Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features for customer churn.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring:** Deploy the trained model to predict potential churned customers in real-time. Monitor the model's performance over time and refine it as needed.
